# SQLite3 Commands Guide

## Introduction
SQLite3 is a lightweight and self-contained database that operates via the command-line interface (CLI). This guide provides a step-by-step explanation of basic SQLite3 commands.

## Step-by-Step Commands

### 1. Starting SQLite3
First, open the terminal or command prompt and enter the following command:
```sh
sqlite3
```
**Output:**
```
SQLite version 3.39.2 2022-07-21 15:24:47
Enter ".help" for usage hints.
sqlite>
```
This will open the SQLite3 shell.

### 2. Opening or Creating a Database
If you already have a database, you can open it. If not, this command will create a new one:
```sh
.open mydatabase.db
```
**Output:** (No visible output, but the database will be opened)
```
sqlite>
```

### 3. Checking Available Tables
To see the tables present in the database, use the following command:
```sh
.tables
```
**Output (If no tables exist):**
```
sqlite>
```
**Output (If tables exist):**
```
users   orders   products
```

### 4. Checking Table Data
To view the data inside a specific table, use this command:
```sh
SELECT * FROM users;
```
**Output:**
```
id  | name     | age
--------------------
1   | Ali      | 25
2   | Sara     | 22
3   | Ahmed    | 30
```

### 5. Improving Output Formatting
By default, the output may not be easily readable. To improve formatting, use these commands:
```sh
.mode column
.headers on
```
Then, check the data again:
```sh
SELECT * FROM users;
```
**Output (Formatted Table View):**
```
id  name   age  
--- ------ ---- 
1   Ali    25   
2   Sara   22   
3   Ahmed  30   
```

### 6. Exporting Data to CSV Format
If you want to export the table data to a CSV file, use the following commands:
```sh
.mode csv
.output users.csv
SELECT * FROM users;
.output stdout
```
**Output (No terminal response, but `users.csv` file will be created):**
```
sqlite>
```
To check the CSV file, open it in a text editor or spreadsheet software.
